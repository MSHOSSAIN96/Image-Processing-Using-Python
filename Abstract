A kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a tiny matrix used in image processing for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and other tasks. A convolution between the kernel and an image is used to achieve this. There are many types of kernels. Before doing the convolution, we need to consider the properties of the image. By applying a kernel to the components of the image, we can emboss, outline, blur, or sharpen a digital image. As a result, we need to use Python as a tool for this kind of image processing. There are many types of convolutions. One is Separable convolutions, which can be divided into two categories: depthwise separable convolutions and spatial separable convolutions.
